can't use new fantasy solo strings songs, because I left moving tempo field checked. so the audio doesn't line up with the midi.

GOALS / TASKS
-------
- test parallaxing
- write script to place stalagtites, stalgmites, and columns at random locations
- clean up text fields in menus
- clean up frames of beholder float animation
- tune the speed and size of attack for maximum fun. animation should be shorter

--------------
Android issues
- no sound. doesn't seem like we need a permission thing
- somehow the level is starting but it's not loading any enemies so as soon as user
attacks the level ends in victory. not loading the midi file?

can't use new fantasy solo strings songs, because I left moving tempo field checked. so the audio doesn't line up with the midi.

GOALS / TASKS
-------
- clean up text fields in menus
- clean up frames of beholder float animation
- tune the speed and size of attack for maximum fun. animation should be shorter

I feel like I made things worse today. there is fuckery going on with the various hitboxes. situations are arising where the player makes an attack and hits an enemy, but the player
collider is being hit after the enemy has been removed from the queue. I guess the enemy 2d collider takes a while to disable??

I just need one level where it feels like the timing for inputting attacks matches the visual of the enemy getting close enough for the entire song. ehhhhhhh

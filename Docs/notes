can't use new fantasy solo strings songs, because I left moving tempo field checked. so the audio doesn't line up with the midi.

GOALS
-------
- get state machine working cleanly (run, attack, hit, rebound?, win, lose)
- fix attack/run animation mess. change to matching attack frames for n frames then go back to run frames
- clean up frames of beholder float animation
- UI for current health and max health of player

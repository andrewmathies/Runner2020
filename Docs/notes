can't use new fantasy solo strings songs, because I left moving tempo field checked. so the audio doesn't line up with the midi.

GOALS / TASKS
-------
- add to BackgroundGenerator
    - change size of placed objects pseudo-randomly
    - need to find floor position and then set position by calculating distance
- fix the background so it scooby doos better. wtf did I pay for
- hire Mitch to make some concept art for a dark souls-esque running knight guy
- add lighting and shadows
- clean up text fields in menus
- tune the speed and size of attack for maximum fun. animation should be shorter
- obstacles seem to slowly get behind the music. at the end of the level I'm tapping a full half beat late to time the tap with the enemy. we have a hacky solution, can we do better?

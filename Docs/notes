can't use new fantasy solo strings songs, because I left moving tempo field checked. so the audio doesn't line up with the midi.

GOALS
-------
- add logic for being hit to player system state machine
- clean up frames of beholder float animation
- UI for current health and max health of player
- tune speed / size of attack hit box for maximum fun
- add more space at beginning between player and first obstacle. it's too close to react rn
